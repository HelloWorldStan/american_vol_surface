## About

My initial goal was to find robust way of generating arb-free vol surface on single stock option quotes, so that I would be able to determine change in portfolio liquidation value for change in moments of vol, spreads, cost of carry, price of underlying and time. I have decided to use Gatheral's Surface Stohastic Volatility Inspired (SSVI) method for this, but had few issues with poor fit, which was expected as I was using vols from american quotes which explode in wings, particularly before the ex-date. So instead of direct minimisation on raw vols I had to first de-americanise them, by deducting the premium they command with respect to european quotes.

For this I went along with Kim integral approximation method instead of trees, as it has a very useful feature of decomposition of american options value into european base and early exercise values. However, as this method involves numerical solution of quadrature formulas on each step exercise boundary, even with numpy vectorisation and broadcasting it was still a bit too slow. So I wrote the base class in C++ and used ctypes lib to call its functions from Python. Having derived de-americanised vols, I was able to fit SSVI on them directly.

Calibration to the market is done using SLSQP algorithm with constrains and bounds to prevent arbitrage in the surface. Risk neutral density is derived using fitted SSVI parameters with explicit differentiation of BSM formula and primes of surface function. I have changed Jump-wing parameters from 5 to 3 where we now have ATMF Vol, 1st and 2nd derivatives of ATMF variance (skew & kurtosis), when we shock these parameters we can invert them back to raw parameters to get the new vol surface.

All the above is packed into numpy structs to allow for better handling of multi-dimensionality and memory optimisation, ie in case of plotting payoffs and liquidation values wrt dSpot and dTime. I have used plotly and ipwidgets for interface, and voila for the server. 

## Features

- Breakdown of positions liquidation value by Greeks, Spread and EEP for given changes in 11 factors by expiry group.
- Plotting of payoffs and values for dS and dT ranges that use the factor changes as specified by user and consider Spread and EEP.
- Density and total variance plots for referring to absence of arbitrage within the newly generated surface specified by user.
- Daily data with 10 minute interval for 40 listed US single stock option names, with 3 front month expiries per each where available.
- Ability to specify weights for the SSVI fit residual based on gaussian density location and scale parameters.

## Formulas

**Vol Calibration**

SSVI fits on total variance (w) and logstrike (k) space, where we can specify a type of convexity function (phi) and spot-vol correlation function (rho):

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(k) = \frac{\theta_{t}}{2}(1 %2B k\rho(\theta_{t})\phi(\theta_{t}) %2B \sqrt{(k\phi(\theta_{t}) %2B \rho(\theta_{t}))^2 %2B (1-\rho(\theta_{t})^2)})">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k = K/F_{T}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\rho(\theta_{t}) = ae^{-b\theta_{t}} %2B c">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\phi(\theta_{t}) = \eta\theta_{t}^{-\lambda}">

Then we minimise the below residual

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_{ssvi} = \sqrt{w(k,\theta_{t},\phi,\rho)/t}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon = arg min(\sigma_{ssvi} - \sigma_{quotes})^2">

**Risk Neutral Density**

Explicit differentiation of BSM formula leads to:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g(k) = (1-\frac{kw'(k)}{2w(k)})^2-\frac{w'(k)^2}{4}(\frac{1}{w(k)} %2B \frac{1}{4}) %2B \frac{w''(k)}{2}">

Where we need to find 1st and 2nd derivatives of total variance wrt logstrike, so we just take these from the surface function w(k):

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(k) = \frac{\theta}{2}[1 %2B k\rho\phi %2B \sqrt{(k\phi %2B \rho)^{2} + (1 - \rho^{2})}]">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(k){}' = \frac{\theta}{2}[\frac{k\phi^2 %2B \rho\phi}{\sqrt{(k\phi %2B \rho)^2 - \rho^2 %2B 1} %2B \rho\phi}]">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(k){}'' = -[ \frac{\theta\phi^2(\rho^2-1)}{2((k\phi %2B \rho)^2-\rho^2 %2B 1)^\frac{3}{2}} ]">

And to get probability density:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_{-}(k) = -\frac{k}{\sqrt{w}}\frac{\sqrt{w}}{2}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p(k) = \frac{g(k)}{\sqrt{2\pi w(k)}}e^{-\frac{d_{-}(k)}{2}^2}">


**Jumpwings**

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi_{t} = \frac{1}{2}\rho(\theta_{t}) \phi(\theta_{t}) \sqrt{\theta}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_{t} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\theta_{t}}\phi(\theta_{t})(1-\rho)">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c_{t} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\theta_{t}}\phi(\theta_{t})(1 %2B \rho)">
